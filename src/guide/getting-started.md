# Getting started

## Free starter pack
At the beginning of your adventure, you won’t have any cards. The first thing to do, is to claim your starter pack for free (except gas fees). The starter pack contains an amount of cards (at the time I write this article, packs contain 10 cards, but this number is decreasing as there are less and less cards available). We’ll talk more about the free starter pack later in this guide.

## Buy a pack
If you want to be successful on NoodleCards, you will have to get more and more cards to complete your collection and earn rewards. To buy a pack with $NDL, just go to our shop (today a pack costs only 250 $NDL, but this can change as the value of $NDL evolves) and click on “OPEN”. We’ll talk more about pack openings later in this guide.

## Buy a card
If you are looking for a specific card, you can also choose to buy a single card. However, you will have to buy it from another player, who wants to sell it. Just go to our Market and check if someone is selling the card you want.

## Sell a card
You can also sell cards to other players on the Market. You can choose any price in $NDL but be careful, if somebody is selling the same card for a lower price, his offer will probably be filled before your.
