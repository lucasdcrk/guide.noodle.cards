# Earnings

## Social giveaways
Sometimes we will organize giveaways on social media (mainly on Twitter). The prizes can vary from cards (sometimes original cards) to $NDL tokens.

## Complete tasks
You can earn a lot of prizes by completing the tasks of the game. Some tasks are limited, so make sure to be the first to complete them !
You can find the list of open tasks on the app, and we will add new tasks every week (stay tuned).

## Farm $NDL token
If you don't know anything about liquidity pools, we suggest this article from Binance [link].
You can earn $NDL tokens by staking NDL/BNB LP tokens on our pools, which is available on PancakeSwap. The reward is defined in the tokenomics. If you want help for staking, you can look at this video [link].
Be careful, there are some rules you need to understand before staking:
When you stake some tokens, you can’t add any tokens to the staking, you will have to unstake and then stake the total amount you want to stake.
You can only unstake the total amount staked. You can’t unstake a part of the tokens you stake.
If you want to unstake, be sure to harvest before! When you unstake your part, your harvested $NDL resets to 0, remember this!
