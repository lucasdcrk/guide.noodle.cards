# Packs

## Pack opening
You can buy a pack and open it on the shop page of our app. The price is displayedon the page and you can only buy packs with $NDL. The price can change and the amount of cards in packs will always decrease (actually 250 $NDL for 10 cards).
When you open a pack, each card you draw has chances of being of a rarity. Here are the probabilities (which can’t be chagned):
- Legendary : 0.1% per card
- Mythic : 0.6% per card
- Epic : 4.2% per card
- Rare : 25% per card
- Common : 69.9% per card
If all the cards of a character have been drawn, this card becomes not packable and the only way to get one is to buy it from a player who owns one.

## Free starter pack
As we said it before, each player can open a free starter pack. This starter pack isn’t the same as a normal pack because it only contains common cards. This prevents multi-account abuse (a player can create multiple wallets and open free starter packs until he gets a Legendary or high value card).
