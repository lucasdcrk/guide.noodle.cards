## Card rarity
When a new manga character is released in the game, we have to set his rarity. Rarity is mostly defined by the popularity of the character. For example, Naruto is a Legendary character and Sasha from SNK is a Rare character.
There are 5 rarity of cards which are:
- Legendary
- Mythic
- Epic
- Rare
- Common

Each rarity defines the supply of the concerned character. It does mean there are more Epic Sasha cards than Naruto ones.
The supplies are defined in the Smart Contract and it can’t be changed, this is why the Noodle Cards are really rare: if the game gets notoriety, the supply of Naruto will be the same as in the early days.
The supplies are defined this way:
- Legendary: 5 cards/character
- Mythic: 20 cards/character
- Epic: 100 cards/character
- Rare: 500 cards/character
- Common: 1000 cards/character

## Original cards
When we decide to release a new character, we have to create its first card. This card will have a special originality attribute, and the card design will be a bit different.
Obviously, these cards can’t be packed because if a card is packed it does mean that his original version already exists. However, it is possible to win original cards, and we will talk about it later in this guide.
